# GlassEffect

You can use this effect to produce a glass-like effect on top of your SwiftUI `View`s üîç.

It models refraction and reflection of light taking the fresnel effect into account. It also allows one to calculate a "detail" that serves as a visual clue about the shape of the glass.

Be sure to check it in both light and dark mode (especially if you're after reflections ‚ú®).

## How To Use It?

Use as a Swift Package.

Use a [`View.glassEffect` modifier](https://github.com/Czajnikowski/GlassEffect/blob/main/Sources/GlassEffect/GlassEffect.swift#L5-L24). At a minimum, you should be able to run the effect by supplying a normal map texture image. For best results, be sure to use high-quality normal maps.

## Credits

I used a bunch of resources from [3dtextures.me](https://3dtextures.me) and [everytexture.com](https://everytexture.com/) in the example app.

## Why?

I made it mostly for myself as an exercise in my recent `SwiftUI` + `Metal` research.
